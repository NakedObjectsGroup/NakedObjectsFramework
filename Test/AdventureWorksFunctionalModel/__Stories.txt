1. Product_MenuFunctions.FindProductByName
- Minimal implementation of IContainer, with only Instances method working
- Container to be automatically injected as a parameter.

2. Product_MenuFunctions.RandomProduct
- Implementation of Container.GetService<T>() 
- Registration of the RandomSeedGenerator service (currently in new NakedFunctions.Services project) as of type IRandomSeedGenerator. Service should be instantiated each time it is used, and using the zero param constructor.

3. Product_MenuFunctions.FindProductByNumber
- Recognition of returned tuple ([domaintype], IContainer)
- Implementation of Container.WithOutput method.
- Implementation of IAlert service, resulting  in inclusion of user warnings/info in RO.

4. SpecialOffer_Functions.EditDescription
- Implementation of Container.WithPendingSave & PendingSave (see note on IContainer).
- Use of this information to udate object(s).
- Edit methods for Discount, Type & Category should also then work

5. SpecialOffer_Functions.EditDates
- Registration of Clock (implementation of IClock) service, found in NakedFunctions.Service

6. SpecialOffer_Functions.AssociateWithProduct
- Should now work, but testing that Container.PendingSave can now also save new objects.
- ProductFunctions.AssociateWithSpecialOffer should then also work.

7. Sales_MenuFunctions.Menu
- Recognise NakedFramework.Menu.IMenu & IMenuFactory (in addition to NakedObjects versions) (& mark latter obsolete)
