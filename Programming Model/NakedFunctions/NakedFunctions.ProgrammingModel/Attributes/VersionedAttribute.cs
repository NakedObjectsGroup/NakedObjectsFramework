///     Tells framework that the property (typically a DateTime or an integer) represents
///     the version of the instance. This is so that the framework can test that the user is
///     making changes to the current version - given that the user view may be minutes, even
///     hours, old. This attribute may be applied to the same property that is also used
///     for the EntityFramework 'concurrency check' (which may be specified by the
///     System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ConcurrencyCheck attribute, or using the
///     fluent data mapping API) - but these are two separate checks, and both are typically .
///     necessary in a multi-user system.
