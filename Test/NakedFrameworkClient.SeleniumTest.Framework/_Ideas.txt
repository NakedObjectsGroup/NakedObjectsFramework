1. All 'actions' should know the expected resulting view(s) and should wait for view(s) of that type.  
If the view(s) would be the same TYPE(s) as before, then it should wait for a change.
Ideally, this can be done generically, by testing equality of view level web element.

Might have to watch out for derived properties or collections where there is a delay. 

Alternative is to have specific 'wait for change to' options e.g. title, property value. 

2. All click actions should offer option to specify left/right, defaulting to left. 
The returned view may therefore be left or right or single pane. (Probably need a Pane view type as
superclass of ListView ObjectView HomeView Error etc -  there was an Enum in previous framework?)
